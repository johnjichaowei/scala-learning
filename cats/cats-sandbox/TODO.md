## Sections skipped in the first round of reading

- 3.6 Contravariant and Invariant Functors
  Come back here before reading Chapter 6.
- 4.5 Aside: Error Handling and MonadError
  Come back here if it is needed when reading Chapter 5.
  We wonâ€™t need to use MonadError unless we need to abstract over error handling monads.
  For example, you can use MonadError to ab- stract over Future and Try,
  or over Either and EitherT (which we will meet in Chapter 5).
- 4.10 Defining Custom Monads
- 5 Monad Transformers
- 11 Case Study: CRDTs
